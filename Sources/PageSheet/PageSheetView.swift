/// Detents allow a sheet to resize from one edge of its fully expanded frame while the other three edges remain fixed.
/// You specify the detents that a sheet supports using `detents`, and monitor its most recently selected detent using `selectedDetentIdentifier`.
///
/// - Note: This view makes it easier to embed `PageSheetView` in custom navigation
/// solutions such as `FlowStacks` and is meant to be presented using a `sheet` modifier.
/// Other ways of presenting may not work, and are not officially supported.
